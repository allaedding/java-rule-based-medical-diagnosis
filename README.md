## I. INTRODUCTION
Expert systems use artificial intelligence to model a decision that experts in the field would make.
Unlike decision support systems that provide several options from which the user may choose,
expert systems convey the concept that the computer has made the best decision based upon
criteria that experts would use.” (Hebda, Czar & Mascara, 1998, p. 254).
Expert systems generate decisions that an expert would make: they can recommend solutions to
nursing problems which mimic the clinical judgement of a nurse expert. These systems are
developed to facilitate and enhance the clinical judgement of nurses, not to replace them. Like
decision support systems, expert systems provide information to help health professionals to make
informed judgements when assessing the validity of data, information, diagnoses, and choices for
treatment and care.

## II. WHAT ARE RULE-BASED SYSTEMS?
Conventional problem-solving computer programs make use of well-structured algorithms, data
structures, and crisp reasoning strategies to find solutions. For the difficult problems with which expert systems are concerned, it may be more useful
to employ heuristics: strategies that often lead to the correct solution, but that also sometimes fail.
Conventional rule-based expert systems, use human expert knowledge to solve real-world problems that
normally would require human intelligence. Expert knowledge is often represented in the form of rules
or as data within the computer.
Depending upon the problem requirement, these rules and data can be recalled to solve problems.
Rule-based expert systems have played an important role in modern intelligent systems and
their applications in strategic goal setting, planning, design, scheduling, fault monitoring, diagnosis and soon.
With the technological advances made in the last decade, today‟s users can choose from dozens of
commercial software packages having friendly graphic user interfaces (Ignizio, 1991).
Conventional computer programs perform tasks using a decision-making logic containing very little
knowledge other than the basic algorithm for solving that specific problem. The basic knowledge
is often embedded as part of the programming code, so that as the knowledge changes, the program has
to be rebuilt. Knowledge-based expert systems collect the small fragments of human know-how
into a knowledge base, which is used to reason through a problem, using the knowledge that is
appropriate. An important advantage here is that within the domain of the knowledge base, a
different problem can be solved using the same program without reprogramming efforts.
Moreover, expert systems could explain the reasoning process and handle levels of confidence
and uncertainty,which conventional algorithms do not handle (Giarratano and Riley, 1989). Some of
the important advantages of expert systems are as  follows:
• ability to capture and preserve irreplaceable human experience;
• ability to develop a system more consistent than human experts;
• minimize human expertise needed at a number of locations at the same time 
(especially in a hostile environment that is dangerous to human health);
• solutions can be developed faster than human experts.
The basic components of an expert system are illustrated in Figure 1. The knowledge base stores
all relevant information, data, rules, cases, and relationships used by the expert system. A
knowledge base can combine the knowledge of multiple human experts. A rule is a conditional
statement that links given conditions to actions or outcomes. A frame is another approach used to
capture and store knowledge in a knowledge base. 
It relates an object or item to various facts or values.
A frame-based representation is ideally suited for object-oriented programming techniques.
Expert systems making use of frames to store knowledge
are also called frame-based expert systems  The purpose of the inference engine is to seek
information and relationships from the knowledge base and to provide answers, predictions, and
suggestions in the way a human expert would. The inference engine must find the right facts,
interpretations, and rules and assemble them correctly. Two types of inference methods are
commonly used – Backward chaining is the process of starting with conclusions and working backward
to the supporting facts. Forward chaining starts with the facts and works forward to the conclusions.
